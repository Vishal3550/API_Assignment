    "# Answer:-An API is a communication interface that allows two separate software components to share data. An API operates as a bridge between internal \n",
    "#         and external software operations, allowing for a fluid interchange of data that frequently passes undetected by the end-user. Simply said, \n",
    "#         an API acts as a virtual middleman, transferring data from one interface, such as a mobile app, to another. APIs connect various sections of \n",
    "#         a software platform to guarantee that information is sent correctly. These connection points serve as an internal communication route, and a \n",
    "#         way for external tools to access the same data. As a result, APIs may be classified into two types:\n",
    "\n",
    "# * Private APIs:- A private API is only available to developers and users within a company. These APIs are often used to link internal team operations\n",
    "#   to remove silos and streamline communication.\n",
    "# * Open APIs:- On the other hand, open APIs allow third-party developers to quickly access and merge data from one tool to another. An open or public API saves time for developers by allowing them to link their platform with already existing tools, minimizing the need to construct new services.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example:-Google login , Google map , Google pay ,Google Search, Apple's Weather app, and even your smart home device.\n",
    "\n",
    "# * APIs are used in web applications to connect user-facing front ends with critical back-end functionality and data."

    "# 3.Compatibility Issues:- APIs can have compatibility issues between different versions of the same software system or between different systems, \n",
